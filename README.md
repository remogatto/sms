# SMS - A concurrent Sega Master System emulator

SMS is a free Sega Master System emulator written in
[Go](http://golang.org). I think it's the first Sega Master System emulator written
in this language.

# Quick start

Installing and starting SMS with Go is simple:

    go get -v github.com/remogatto/sms/
    ./sms game.sms

# Description

SMS is based on a
[concurrent](http://github.com/remogatto/gospeccy/wiki/Architecture)
architecture very similar to
[GoSpeccy](http://github.com/remogatto/gospeccy), another emulator
written in Go.

The primary source of inspiration for SMS was
[Miracle](http://xania.org/miracle/miracle.html), a cool
Javascript SMS emulator.

If you like this project, please star it on
[GitHub](http://github.com/remogatto/sms)! Bug reports and testing are
also appreciated! And don't forget to fork and send patches, of
course.

is included with the emulator. However, it is possible to find tons of games
